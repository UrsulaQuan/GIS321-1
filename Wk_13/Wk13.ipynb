    "    * As a comment to your PR, please let me know how you implemented the Po\n",
    "1. Ensure that the GUI that you created last week is taking the form of a class.  This will ensure that you can track state more easily.  See [here](http://zetcode.com/gui/pyqt4/firstprograms/) for an example of what I mean by, 'the form of a class' (under the heading 'An Application Icon', the `class Example()` code block).\n",

Using this dialog, the user can supply a file of tweets and those tweets are drawn on the map.  Ideally, your window loads a blank map centered on a default location.  When the user loads a file of tweets, the markers are drawn and the window recenters to the mean center of the points.  This will require reloading the HTML in the `QWebView`.  If you struggle with this, you can simply not draw the map until the tweets are opened, and hard code the centering to Phoenix.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Hint: The folium map object has a `__repr__` magic method that returns the map as raw HTML.  The `QWebView` has a method [`setHtml()`](http://pythoncentral.io/pyside-pyqt-tutorial-qwebview/), as well as a method [`reload()`](http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt4/qwebview.html#reload).  I was not able to get `reload()` to properly redraw and instead had to make a second call to `setHtml()`.\n",
