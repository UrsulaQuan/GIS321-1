    "## Classes\n",
    "A class in Python is declared much in the same way that a function is declared.  We will swap `def` for `class`.  A basic class definition looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Foo(object):\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we say, I am declaring a class called `Foo`.  This class inherets from the `object` baseclass.  As an aside - everything in Python is an object, and this declaration is included to create a [new style class](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/54867/what-is-the-difference-between-old-style-and-new-style-classes-in-python) (that link is only if you are interested in the distinction).  A class will have an `__init__` method that takes one or more initialization arguments.  This class takes none.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed `self` being included in the `__init__` methods signature.  Every method (save [@classmethod](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/136097/what-is-the-difference-between-staticmethod-and-classmethod-in-python) and [@staticmethod](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/136097/what-is-the-difference-between-staticmethod-and-classmethod-in-python)) will have `self` as the first argument.  In Python, an instance of a class automatically passes itself to a method of said class.  Methods do not implicitly accept the class instance as the first argument.  Instead the method explicitly takes `self` as the first argument.  Note, `self` is used only by convention.\n",
