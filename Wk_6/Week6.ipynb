We never accounted for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_problem_(spatial_analysis)\">edge effects</a>.  A, potentially computationally expensive alternative, to many of the methods appropriate for dealing with edge effects is Monte Carlo simulation.\n",

Within that domain observations are simulated drawn from some distribution (independent uniform random distribution in our case).  Then a deterministic metric is computed, e.g. mean nearest neighbor distance.  This process is repeated $p$ times, where $p$ is a number of permutations.  Given some number of permutations (we will look at this next week) the observed phenomenon (the point pattern) can be compared to the simulations.  For this week, we will just use the critical points of the Monte Carlo simulation as a metric.  The critical points are the minimum and maximum values observed in the permutations.  For now, we will assert that an observed value outside of the envelope defined by the minimum and maximum values is significant.\n",
