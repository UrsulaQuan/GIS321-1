    "Up until now, we have stuck to using the standard library.  That is, every installation of Python 3.5 that you will ever encounter has the exact same set of functionality as your installation.  The standard library is well suited to solve many tasks, but one of the major strengths of Python is the breadth of available libraries.  These libraries can significantly reduce development time as someone else has already written some piece of functionality and (hopefully) exposed it via a robust, well documented, [Application Programming Interface](http://readwrite.com/2013/09/19/api-defined/) (API).\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the use of an external library is not without some cost.  The primary cost is that of a [dependency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell).  Any user of your software, that uses an external library, must also have installed the same version of the same library.  For example, if I write sections of my code utilizing the NumPy library, I am requiring that all of my users also have the NumPy library.  Most library developers work exceptionally hard to ensure maximum backwards compatability.  This means that, if I use NumPy version 0.1 and you have NumPy 0.2 installed, everything should (~~hopefully~~, maybe) work.\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we will step through a few different numerical and geospatial libraries.  The numerical libraries (NumPy, SciPy, and Pandas) should all already be installed with your Anaconda Python installation.  In fact, these three libraries have become so prevelent that many developers simply assume that they are available.  I caution against assuming this - for example, the ArcMap 10.x installation does not include SciPy or Pandas."

    "[NumPy](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.1/user/whatisnumpy.html) is a library that supports high perforomance mathematical operations applied to structured data types, e.g. vectors, multi-dimensional arrays, matrices, masked arrays.  The primary method for interacting with data in NumPy is the ndarray (n-dimensional array).  The ndarray is a fixed size, fixed data type container.  That is, all of the data within an ndarray must be of the same type (all entries are float64 for example).  For example:"

For example, the following is valid Python, but could not be utilized in NumPy: `x = ['a', 1, 2.0, foo]`, where foo is a function.  The answer is performance.  The link above describes how NumPy achieves such exceptional performance.  The shoft version is pre-compiled C.  By pre-compiling to a 'low-level' language, NumPy can achieve extremely high performance (when compared to standard Python).  Take the following for example:"

    "[SciPy](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/) (Scientific Python) is built ontop of NumPy and offers additional high level optimization, engineering, and scientific analysis functionality.  Checkout the previous link to get a listing of the available modules and to get a feel for what capabilities are available.  Just like NumPy, SciPy is highly optimized (read, awesome performance) to work with the ndarray datatype.  Of particular interest to us is the module [`scipy.spatial`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/spatial.html).  This is a relatively new library that adds support for basic spatial data structures and analyses.  This is **not** a full featured set of spatial analysis tools, but a low level library to get started with some basic spatial work.\n",

    "Before you ask: why on Earth would I ask you to code the euclidean and manhattan distances as functions when SciPy.spatial includes everything you need?  Two reasons.  First, coding those functions is wonderful practice.  Think about all of the low level Python 'things' that are going on.  You wrote a function, you used the `math` module, you accessed a tuple positionally (`x[0]`) or called a method within a method (`getx(x)`).  Second, you need to understand what exactly is happening inside of a function before you start using it.  That is not to suggest that you always need to code your own before using someone elses, but you should understand the mathematics and logic of what should be coming out.  How else do you catch someone else's bugs?"

    "This is space partitioning tree that supports extremely efficient insertion, deletion, and search for n-dimensional data.  In reality the KDTree is highly efficient to about 20 dimensions, after that brute force methods (what we are doing now) are about as effective (average case).  Luckily, we are working with point data, so 2D is well within the high performance threshold.  The basic idea is to parititon space and reduce the number of decisions that must be made during traversal.  In other words, every time that we have a point in 2D space the current search area is bisected by a hyperplane (a line in 2D space).  Using the image above, the first point is A.  The entire region is then split in two: points to the right of A and points to the left of A.  This process continues until a full tree is created.  Using this tree, it is then possible to rapidly search for the nearest neighbor.  Let's take a look at how this can be done using NumPy (to create a random point pattern) and SciPy (to create and query a KD-Tree)."

Even discounting the python vs. pre-compiled C differences, a nearest neighbor search as we have coded it has an $O(n^{2})$ runtime, while a KD-TRee is average case $O(\\log{n})$ for insertion and search (a hefty performance difference).  How then can you store points with attributes while still maintaining a numpy n-dimensionally array that the KD Tree would like?\n",

    "3. Add an attribute to your Point class that returns an array [x,y] and then stack those to generate the necessary numpy array in one go (see the cell below for how you can do this).\n",
